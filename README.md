    Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affecting over 6 million patients worldwide. PD is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms , with the former mainly consisting of resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and akinesia. Such disabling symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease can be partially alleviated by the use of deep brain stimulation technology , through delivering a constant high-frequency stimulation (~130Hz) to either subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal globus pallidus (GPi).
    Both men and women can have Parkinson’s disease. However, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women.
