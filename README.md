# Parkinson's-Detection-System
   
   -->Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affecting over 6 million patients worldwide. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. 
  
  -->PD is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms , with the former mainly consisting of resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and akinesia. 
   
   -->Such disabling symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease can be partially alleviated by the use of deep brain stimulation technology , through delivering a constant high-frequency stimulation (~130Hz) to either subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal globus pallidus (GPi).
  
  -->Both men and women can have Parkinson’s disease. However, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women.
