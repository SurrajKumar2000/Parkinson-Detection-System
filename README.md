# Parkinson's-Detection-System
   
   -->Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. 
   
   -->Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, affecting over 6 million patients worldwide. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. 
  
  -->PD is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms , with the former mainly consisting of resting tremor, muscle rigidity, and akinesia. 
   
   -->Such disabling symptoms in advanced Parkinson’s disease can be partially alleviated by the use of  **Deep Brain Stimulation Technology** , through delivering a constant high-frequency stimulation (~130Hz) to either subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal globus pallidus (GPi).
  
  -->Both men and women can have Parkinson’s disease. However, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women.

   -->In this project **Dimensionality Reduction Method [PCA]** is used to filter the most frequently occured data and the models are trained and tested in **Linear Regression,KNN,Random Forest**.
   
   
# Symptoms

     **Impaired posture and balance**

     **Rigid muscles**

     **Slowed movement (bradykinesia)**

     **Speech changes**

     **Writing changes**

# Prevention

**Because the cause of Parkinson's is unknown, proven ways to prevent the disease also remain a mystery.**

**Some research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease.**

# Conclusion
 
  Among the various models tested **Random Forest Classifier** gives greatest accuracy of **96%-98%**.
